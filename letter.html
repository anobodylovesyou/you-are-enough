    <h1>ðŸ’Œ A Letter From My Heart</h1>

    <p>My Love,</p>

    <p>
      I know that life can be incredibly heavy sometimes. I know there are moments when the world feels silent, when your heart aches quietly, and when even taking one step forward feels impossible. But even in those moments â€” especially in those moments â€” I need you to remember something:
    </p>

    <p><strong>You are the strongest person I have ever known.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Your strength isnâ€™t just in how you carry yourself when everything is going well. Your strength is in how you rise even when everything is pulling you down. Iâ€™ve seen it in your eyes, in your resilience, in the way you continue to give your love even when you feel empty. I admire that more than words can say. In truth, <strong>you are my biggest inspiration.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      When I feel lost, I think of your courage. When I want to give up, I remember your fight. And when I doubt myself, I remind myself that the strongest person Iâ€™ve ever met believes in me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I look up to you â€” not because you pretend to be okay, but because even when youâ€™re not okay, you keep going. And that is a strength few people truly understand. You have taught me what it means to love fiercely, to endure gently, and to live with compassion and courage.
    </p>

    <p>
      So please â€” when you're low, when you're hurting, when everything feels like it's falling apart â€” <strong>remember who you are</strong>. You are not alone. You are never too much. You are never a burden. You are deeply, unshakably loved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even when you canâ€™t see it, even when you canâ€™t feel it, <strong>I am here</strong>. Always. Holding your hand, lifting your heart, and walking beside you through every high and low.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please donâ€™t ever forget how much light you carry. The world â€” <em>my world</em> â€” is brighter because youâ€™re in it.
    </p>

    <div class="signature">
      With all the love I have,<br />
      Forever yours,<br />
      The one who believes in you most ðŸ’–
